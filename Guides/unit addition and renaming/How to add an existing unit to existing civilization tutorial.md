# How to add an existing unit to an existing civilization

By Arkth

## Introduction

Hi, and Welcome to this Quick Tutorial about "*How to add an existing unit to an existing Civilization*". Please excuse my english, but I'll try to explain myself the best I can - with screenshots. 

## Instructions

### 1. Step

 First of all, replace an "*undefined*" slot in **dbeffects.dat**. For this example I use the Samurai.

After that, we choose to Enable Tech: and picked the Samurai, as you can see in the image.

### 2. Step

Now with effect created, we add it to the **dbevents.dat**.

### 3. Step

We can go back to the **dbeffects** and jump to the Tech this way.

### 4. Step

Right there we disable fields 38, 39 and 40, related to Civ powers - because our handsome Samurai guy would be a Civ power now.
