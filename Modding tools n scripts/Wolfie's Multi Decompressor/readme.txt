This program will decompress any Empire Earth file extracted using EE Studio.  It will decompress an entire folder or any selected files within that folder.  To use it, simply browse for a folder where you have compressed files, browse to where you want them extracted to.  Select the files in the list box you want decompressed.  You can either decompress them immediately using the "Decompress" button or you can generate a BAT file using the "Make BAT file" Button.  Notepad will open up with the batch file inside it.  You can copy/paste or save as to put the batch file anywhere you want it.  You can generate several bat files and paste them all into one file to have everything done at once from a single batch file.

If you don't have VB6 runtime libraries, you will need them: http://www.wolfiesden.com/downloads/images/vbrun.htm

You will also need EE Studio installed.

Unzip this program to the same folder where you installed EE Studio OR you can copy DCL.EXE from your EE Studio folder to where you want this program to run from.
