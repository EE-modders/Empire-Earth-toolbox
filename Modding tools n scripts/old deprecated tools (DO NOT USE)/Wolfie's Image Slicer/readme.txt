This program will open BMPs, JPGs and GIFs.  Empire Earth requires terrain tiles to be 128x128 and there needs to be 4 of them.  The entire texture for a terrain set is 256x256.  This program will open any sized image though it is intended to load 256x256.  It will then slice it up into four 128x128 tiles.  It will save them using a base name you supply in the save dialog box and append _1, _2, _3, and _4 to the four filenames respecivly.  Yes, you can do all this in an image editor but I found it far easier to simply create the 256x256 tilable image and run it through this slicer, it takes a matter of seconds and they are sliced and saved.

If you don't have VB6 runtime libraries, you will need them: http://www.wolfiesden.com/downloads/images/vbrun.htm

Unzip this program to the same folder where you installed EE Studio OR you can unzip it to any folder where you want this program to run from.
