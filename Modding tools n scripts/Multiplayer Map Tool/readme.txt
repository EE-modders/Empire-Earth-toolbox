Limitations:

    This (evaluation) version is limited to [4] Human Player Keys and [0] CPU Keys.

    Default Player Names Generated are; Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, Player 4, (Player 5, Player 6, Player 7, and Player 8 are not available until the full version). CPU slot keys are not available until the final version.

    Although Player Names can be changed in the EE Scenario Editor, the Default Player Names generated can not be changed in multiplayer, therefore the default names takes precedence. Players must use the default or preset names. Choosing another name other than provided will prevent you from joining or hosting the game.

    Editing Player Names is possible with this tool but is limited to eight characters per name. Player Names must be eight characters long, no less and no more. Using spaces in the beginning or end of a name will generate an error.

    While editing, choosing more or less humans than generated by EEMMT v.1.0 is not possible. Once opened as a human player slot, the slot remains as a human player slot and the same applies to CPU slots. So, choose the exact number of human or CPU players you want to use before generating and editing.
