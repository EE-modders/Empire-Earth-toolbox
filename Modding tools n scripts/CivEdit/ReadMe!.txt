Usage:
*********************************************************************************************
Layout explains the usage, mostly. The drop down menu lists all the bonus categories.
Selecting one will show you the available bonuses and the starting cost. Each time 
you select a bonus (with the >> button) the cost of the remaining bonuses is that 
category is raised by a set value. You can see the increment value by looking at the 
box labeled "Cost Increment". By the same token when you de-select a bonus (with the 
<< button) the cost of bonuses in that category are decreased by the increment value.

When you save your .CIV it will automatically place the file in your Empre Earth 
civilizations folder. When you launch the game you will see your new .CIV is available.

Cheating:
*********************************************************************************************
This program will not allow you to cheat. You cannot create a .CIV with more than 100
attribute points. Even if you could EE does not allow the file to load completely.

Hacked copies:
********************************************************************************************
All features may not work with stolen/hacked copies of Empire Earth. This is your problem.
Buy this game.

Known problems:
*********************************************************************************************
1. If you select a civilization name that already exists and save it, the 
original is overwritten with no questions asked.

2. Does not yet open .CIV files. Only creates new ones.

3. ??? Please send all bug reports and suggestions to: STUPIDFLY01@HOTMAIL.COM.
