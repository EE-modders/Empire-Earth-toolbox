Bink 2 now has complete HDR support!  Compress and playback high color-depth videos
directly in your HDR game!</li><li>Bink 2 how has an Adobe Premiere and Media Encoder plugin for direct Bink 2 and Bink 2 HDR
exporting!</li><li>The Bink desktop video player now uses Direct3D 11 as the default output option on Windows 7+.  Can still
optionally DIB mode, but D3D11 gives smooth page flipping and faster performance (but hopefully won't drive me
crazy with driver support issues).</li><li>Updated the Bink plugin to UE4 4.16.</li><li>Added full video alpha override to the Bink plugins.</li><li>Updated the UE4 Bink plugin to allow rendering to any render target.</li><li>Updated to Nintendo Switch SDK 3.0, added mutex protection around audio calls.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6g/1.200g to 2.6h/1.200h (4-5-2017)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6g/1.200g to 2.6h/1.200h (4-5-2017)</b></a></div>

<ul><li><p>
Updated the async routines so that you can queue up as much work as you want on any
one async thread (will just block after 64 frame-decodes get queued).  
Also, you can start up to 64 async threads on Windows, Linux and Mac now.</li><li>In the Unity and UE4 plugins, fixed a problem where we were unloading XAudio, even if
it failed to load.  This is normally harmless, but on some Windows installs when running with
no sound card, you could get a shutdown crash.</li><li>Fixed a path problem loading video files in the UE4 plugin on Android.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6e/1.200e to 2.6f/1.200f (2-6-2017)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6e/1.200e to 2.6f/1.200f (2-6-2017)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
On PS4, Bink now sets the async thread affinities to share across the cores that you specify,
(so that even if one core is overloaded on some other game code, Bink can continue decoding on
the other async cores). In practice, this is makes a big difference in playback speed, when you
are doing work in the background.  This was already how Bink worked on other platforms (which
all have soft thread affinities).</li><li>Fixed a linker problem in the iOS plugin for Unity and UE4.</li><li>Fixed a problem where render targets on the UE4 for PS4 wouldn't have SRGB turned on.</li><li>In the Unity and UE4 plugins, we don't clear the rendertarget first, if there is only
one movie drawing to the RT - this makes a big speed differences on PS4 and mobile.</li><li>The binaries for the UE4 Bink plugin should now be placed in the /Bink directory
(vs the Movies directory).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6d/1.200d to 2.6e/1.200e (1-19-2017)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6d/1.200d to 2.6e/1.200e (1-19-2017)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added new function to the Unity and UE4 plugins, so you can limit the number
of output speakers - this lets you play 5.1 audio on stereo speakers.  Stereo output
is now the default, you need to call BinkPluginLimitSpeakers to bump up the limit for
5.1 or 7.1 output.</li><li>Fixed a compressor problem where if the entire alpha plane was zero, we would
ignore the disable alpha-weighting option.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6c/1.200c to 2.6d/1.200d (1-9-2017)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6c/1.200c to 2.6d/1.200d (1-9-2017)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Switched the BinkTextureGL support to use slightly oversized textures
when s_HasUnpackRowLength is not available. This is a big speed up on OpenGL ES
platforms.</li><li>Reorganized the UE4 plugin source - delete the Bink directory under Plugins
before you install this new version.</li><li>Fixed a few multithreaded PS4 UE4 problems.</li><li>Changed the IO and sound threads to not be locked to any single core. You
can stick lock these threads to a particular core with BinkGetPlatformInfo manually. 
This is more compatible in the general case when we don't know how your threads are
laid out - neither thread does any heavy work, so it should be unnoticeable anyway.</li><li>Added UI option to show just the color plane of alpha movies (handy when 
alpha plane stores non-alpha data).</li><li>Versioned some atomic internal functions on static library platforms to handle
linking with multiple RAD products using different versions of the atomics (fixes a 
PS4 Bink and older Telemetry issue).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6b/1.200b to 2.6c/1.200c (11-22-2016)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6b/1.200b to 2.6c/1.200c (11-22-2016)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Changes to support UE 4.14.</li><li>Fixed a bug in BinkWaitStopAsyncThread on the new platform.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.6a/1.200a to 2.6b/1.200b (11-14-2016)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.6a/1.200a to 2.6b/1.200b (11-14-2016)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Fixed a problem with sound on Linux on UE4 and Unity.</li><li>Switched to new locking primatives on a number of platforms - should be faster and work around nonsense like Linux clock changes (do not get me started on absolute lock timeouts).</li><li>Added support for a new secret platform.</li><li>Fixed crashes in BinkGoto when using GPU decoding and cleaned up seeking in general.</li><li>Added Windows Universal support for both UE4 and Unity.</li><li>Worked around some Unity issues when switching between fullscreen and windowed modes on Windows and Mac.</li><li>Made BinkOpenXAudio2 a little less error prone when you update. Just pass in 2 zeros, if you want us to init everything for you.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the rescaler that with certain rescaling factors would put a black bar along the right side of the video.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Mac player, where it showed an Error opening buffer message.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.5u/1.100u to 2.6a/1.200a (10-3-2016)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.5u/1.100u to 2.6a/1.200a (10-3-2016)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Both Bink 1 and Bink 2 upgraded to play 64-bit video files (larger than 4 GB Bink files). 
Compressor, mixer, player, runtime all updated.  Bink files less than 4GB are still compatible with old
versions. These updates pushed some changes out to the memory and file IO callbacks, so very minor code 
changes may be necessary.</li><li>Added UE4 support for Xbox One. We now support all native UE4 platforms.</li><li>Support cook-on-the-fly mode for UE4 on PS4.</li><li>Added Unity support for Xbox One. We now support all native Unity platforms.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.5t/1.100t to 2.5u/1.100u (9-21-2016)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.5t/1.100t to 2.5u/1.100u (9-21-2016)</b></a></div>

<ul><li><p>
Worked around yet another autovec codegen bug in GCC for Linux 64 - kids, just say no to vectorization.</li><li>The BinkSoundUseXAudio2 changed to take a BINK_XAUDIO2_INFO structure pointer (contains
pointers to the XAudio device and the mastering voice).

Binktexture pixel shaders (convenient for render-to-texture).</li><li>Added PRX versions of the Bink for Sony PS4.</li><li>Allocate the Bink texture memory in the BinkTexture API on PS4 in one big allocation (rather
than 6 to 8 smaller ones).</li><li>Added shared library versions of Bink for Android.</li><li>Added some sound interruption code to the example for iOS 9+.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.5p/1.100p to 2.5q/1.100q (5-11-2016)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.5p/1.100p to 2.5q/1.100q (5-11-2016)</b></a></div>

Fixed a few bugs with ancient Bink 1 old audio format files.</li><li>Added new updated Japanese docs.</li><li>Mac builds now use SSE 3 as their minimum architecture.</li><li>The RAD tools no longer pre-read all of the images in a still-image sequence.

this later.</li><li>Added GPU-assistance for Windows 10 Universal and RT targets.</li><li>All new software blitters - higher quality and available for all platforms. We continue to recommend not using software blitters and to use the GPU for color conversion, though.</li><li>Dropped all the scaling compression options (2x height, 2x height interlaced, etc). No modern app should need these old school modes.</li><li>Dropped the SPU version of the Bink decoder (which cleans up the codebase considerably). You can

<ul><li><p>
Big new version! Lots of compression improvements, mostly for alpha and near-lossless videos. This version
includes a format change, so you need to update the tools and your SDK at the same time.</li><li>We now recommend you use normal alpha video (non-premultiplied) when compressing with Bink, since this gives us the smoothest
signal for compressing.  Normal alpha is the default output format for video packages, so this should be easy.  You
usually want to use the 'filter-as-premultiplied-and-convert-back-to-non-premultiplied' option when compressing -
this gives the best compression quality.</li><li>When using the 'filter-as-premultiplied-and-convert-back-to-non-premultiplied' option, Bink now back fills the 
zero alpha areas with smooth, easy-to-compress color blocks.</li><li>The Bink player now displays the alpha plane with a checker-board background so you can see it post-alpha (it assumes
non-premultiplied). Press 'b' to change the brightness of the alpha plane.</li><li>Areas of the video that have areas of all alpha zero values are weighted to zero in the compressor - this gives huge improvements to
almost all alpha videos.  You can turn off this weighting if you are storing non-alpha data in the alpha plane.</li><li>Frames with constant alpha are stored in a much more efficient form. Effectively, there is no cost for frames that have 
all constant alpha values (good for videos that fade in the alpha to a max of 255, for example).</li><li>Bink audio decompression is now about 3 times faster (huge SIMD optimizations in our iDCT code).  Bink audio was already
fast and now it's crazy fast (not that much slower than crappy ADPCM).</li><li>Deblocking is applied slightly differently - gives better quality with fewer artifacts and is faster.</li><li>Videos with lots of flat color (cartoons and sprites for example) can be compressed much smaller.</li><li>Various improvements to the general Bink compressor.</li><li>Old versions of Bink would use bandwidth attempting to microscopically improve near-lossless blocks. Now, Bink is better about using bandwidth for more important improvements.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 2.4i/1.994k to 2.4m/1.994m (01-06-2015)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 2.4i/1.994k to 2.4m/1.994m (01-06-2015)</b></a></div>

after BinkDoFrame or BinkDoFrameAsyncWait returns), you call Finish_Bink_texture_update.  Start replaces Wait_for_Bink_textures and Lock_Bink_textures, and Finish replaces Unlock.</li><li>New BinkTextures draw function - you now just specify two device coordinates (0 to 1 based), so the size is consistent
across different screens, and you no longer use a weird zoom parameter. Much simpler.</li><li>Switched to pre-compiled shaders on most platforms. Our shader source is listed in the comments, so you can always

usual tearing issues on slow scrolling videos in Aero mode on Windows).</li><li>Multithreaded the resizing of videos during compression - compression can be 
many times faster if you are resizing.</li><li>On Android x86, used a dummy silence sound buffer to prevent clicks and to avoid

Big new version: new file format, new features, new platforms!</li><li>Bink now allows you to use 3-way, 4-way and 8-way multicore slicing at compression time.
This means you can create videos that scale across more cores. So now, with 8-way slicing, you

get much faster too.</li><li>Note that the Bink 2.3 compressor can still create Bink 2.2 compatible files - just set the slice
count to '2 (Bink 2.2 format)'.</li><li>Added new edge detection on the deblocker - videos with edges that align right onto
8x8 blocks will look much better.</li><li>New Bink decompression API to use many cores for decompression.</li><li>On Xbox One, added support for Direct3D monolithic mode.</li><li>On Xbox One, fixed a bug in the Xaudio initialization.</li><li>On PS4, fix a bug where the IO and sound thread priorities were too low.</li><li>On PS4, fixed a synch issue if you paused and resumed over and over.</li><li>Updated to most recent Xbox One and PS4 SDKs.</li><li>Updated the GL texture code for faster texture uploading (especially on Android).</li><li>Updated the Windows threaded example code to use many cores (instead of just two).</li><li>Fixed a crash on Android when a file doesn't exist in the asset manager.</li><li>Fixed a rare crash (divide by zero) from the IO thread if you were near the end

Huge new 2.2 version - we probably should have called it 3.0. All Bink 2 users should upgrade and recompress.</li><li>All new codec (new file format) - massive quality and speed improvements.</li><li>Use *half* the data rate as Bink 2.1!  720p at 600K, 1080p at 1200K! Experiment with low-rates - we are 
commonly surprised at how low we can take some videos now.  Smaller is also faster to decode!</li><li>Encoder is twice as fast as 2.1. It is now almost 3 times faster than Bink 1, and will encode 720p at 60 fps with 16 cores.</li><li>New perceptual based variable quantizer - quality is vastly improved at all data rates,
but especially low rates.</li><li>Uses any dimension of video (padding done internally) - 3D support code all updated to support
padded widths and heights.</li><li>Improvements to colorspace converters (where some videos would be a little blue).  Make sure you update
your shader constants too.</li><li>Huge decoder speedups! 1.5x to 2x faster playing the same 2.1 videos.  Faster still if you compress
the videos at a lower rate with 2.2 (which will look the same).  720p videos are under 1 millisecond per frame
now on x86.</li><li>SSE3 and SSSE3 optimizations.</li><li>PS3 version is much, much faster and smaller (GCC inliner kept under control).</li><li>Deblocking is much faster, and you can turn it off completely for even more speed.</li><li>Updated to latest Xenon, PS3, Wii-U, PS4 and Xbox One SDKs.</li><li>Support for Telemetry 2.</li><li>Linux 64-bit build now includes software blitters for the Bink 2 colorspace.</li><li>Added PS4 and Xbox One docs.</li><li>Turned off UPX EXE compression, since drunk interns seem to write McAffee's virus detector (pro-tip: decompress

APIs are actually doing. To change, remove BINKNOFRAMEBUFFERS from BinkOpen, pass in the width and
height of the movie to Create_Bink_textures, remove the call to Lock_Bink_textures, rename the call
to Unlock_Bink_textures to Update_Bink_textures, and remove the call to BinkRegisterFrameBuffers.</li><li>Added video width and height parameters on Create_Bink_textures in the BinkTexture.h API,
so that we can handle non-divisible by 16 videos on the graphics APIS that allow it.</li><li>Updated the DX9 Exam3DpsThr.cpp example to show how to handle a device reset (and added two

The Bink encoder has been massively tweaked using Telemetry - up to twice as fast on many core machines (4+ cores).</li><li>Decoder IO system completely rewritten. IO is now done later in pipeline (more opportunity for background IO). And even under 
starvation conditions, IO happens on the async thread.  Better yet, when playing multiple Binks at a time, all IO is co-operatively scheduled.  Again,
all these optimizations performed using Telemetry.</li><li>Telemetry integration in the Bink compressor, Bink player, and Bink SDK.  More information soon.</li><li>Multichannel output functions overhauled - the new BinkSetSpeakerVolumes function is cross-platform compatible and

Fixed a rare bug that would cause the background IO thread to use 100% of the CPU when IO was suspended. If
you are loading data while streaming a video, this will greatly help your performance (especially on PS3 which doesn't
have a spare core to hide the problem).</li><li>Switch the MacOS X version of the Bink library to use Unix paths (no more FSSpecs).</li><li>Fixed the screen vertices on Windows, Xbox and Xenon, so that videos will play properly with bi-linear turned off.</li><li>Changed the Wii texture code to draw in 32x32 pixel chunks - this almost doubles (!) the texturing speed (better texture cache
usage), and it fixes the previous problem of artifacts when scaling a texture (which means the Wii texturing precision problem was in triangle setup
and not the texture iterators as I previously suspected). Note that this fix is in WiiTextures.c, which is sample code that you
generally integrate into your game, so make sure you merge these changes!</li><li>Cleaned up the 3D window resizing code in the Windows examples.</li><li>Added error reporting to the SPU setup code, so you can call BinkGetError to better see what went wrong.</li><li>Fixed a crash when using BinkMix to remove a track that wasn't present in the input file.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.9k to 1.9L (01-14-2009)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.9k to 1.9L (01-14-2009)</b></a></div>

Added SIMD versions of the Bink audio decoder for MMX, SSE, SSE2, PS3 VMX, Xbox 360 VMX, and Sony PS2. The Bink audio decoder
is already really fast (usually less than a few percent on most platforms), but it's now faster still.</li><li>Added the new BinkDoFramePlane function which lets you decompress specific planes of a video frame (like just the alpha, or just the Y).</li><li>Added support for Miles 7.2d and up.</li><li>Fixed two bugs in the Nintendo Wii GPU color conversion sample code. The first bug would draw your movies too bright (blacks
would be slightly gray). The second bug selected three indirect stages instead of two, so game state could be incorrectly inherited.
These bugs were fixed in <b>wiitextures.c</b> which is supplied in source form, so be sure to update the copy in your game.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Wii audio code where very long movies (around 8 minutes) would start to fall out of sync.</li><li>Fixed sync problems for all Windows sound providers (DirectSound, waveOut, and Miles) where newer sound chipsets (most
motherboard sound chips) that have a natural sample rate of 48000, will play non-48K audio (like 44100 Hz) at the incorrect rate
(like 44130 Hz).  This slight clock difference slowly leads to sync problems in longer movies. We now measure the sound rate
and slowly compensate the video to match. It's amazing that in 2008 we are still having these problems.</li><li>On the Nintendo DS, added the embedded middleware notices.</li><li>On the PS3, added vectorized sound mixing in the hand-off to libaudio. This is one of the few tasks done on the PPU and it
only uses about 1%, but, in any case, it is now about 3.5 times faster.</li><li>Switched the PS2 example code to use GPU color conversion. This uses about half the dynamic memory during playback
and doubles the amount of CPU that Bink can use for decompression.  This means you can now playback <b>much</b> higher quality
Bink movies on PS2. Since this technique is so much better, we removed the software blitters to save another 32K in code space. You
can still use the old Bink library, if you don't want to update to the new technique (but there's no reason not to switch).</li><li>Fixed a bug on the Xbox 360 and Win32, where if you were playing two videos simultaneously on one background hardware thread, only 
one video would be advanced.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DirectSound code, where long thread delays during playback would play the previous contents of the audio 
buffer (leading to looping audio), instead of silence.</li><li>Fixed a bug on the Xbox 360 where you could get an XAudio 2 assert if you changed the master volume of a mono track.</li><li>Updated the analysis window with more modern data rate target graphs.</li><li>Added Smacker 4.2d to the RAD Video Tools.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.9g to 1.9h (05-20-2008)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.9g to 1.9h (05-20-2008)</b></a></div>

overall memory footprint a bit).</li><li>Switched a bunch of temporary buffers to the stack with alloca on Windows, Xbox 360, PS3 and SPU. This
usually lets us load higher resolution movies in tight memory situations.</li><li>Return from BinkNextFrame and BinkGoto if there is an asynchronous decompression already in progress.</li><li>Fixed an IO buffer problem on the Wii, that would cause very small Binks to fail to load.</li><li>In the RAD Video Tools, try using our built-in file readers for TIFF and JPEG before trying QuickTime - this is much faster.</li><li>Improved the Xbox 360 mix bin support code, so that you can modify the speaker mix during playback.</li><li>Switched to the November Xbox 360 SDK.</li><li>Fixed a bug where ancient Bink files (created before January 2000) would play incorrectly on multi-CPU boxes.</li><li>Fixed a filename length overrun when creating Bink files in very deep file paths.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.8x to 1.9a (11-04-2007)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.8x to 1.9a (11-04-2007)</b></a></div>

The big asynchronous decompression release!  Bink now supports built-in background decompression on Windows,
Xbox 360 and Sony PS3 (using SPUs).  All of this is done super cleanly, it requires very few code changes, and you don't
have to do any direct multi-threaded coding at all.</li><li>Added SPU decompression support on the PS3 - Bink now takes no PPU time at all! You can play up to ten 1280x720
on the six SPUs at the same time, or up to 36 640x480 movies simultaneously! The PS3 is really fast when
you can harness the SPUs.</li><li>Added support for background decompression on Windows.  All games should use threaded decompression now - it
is faster even on single core CPUs (because the blitting takes place concurrently with decompression). The standalone
Bink Player has also been threaded.</li><li>Dropped the requirement to do a Sync_Bink_textures on Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii.  We now do the cache flush
ourselves in the codec (which is faster).</li><li>Added some clean-up code to the Draw_Bink_textures function on Wii, so that the GX API isn't left in such 
a weird state.</li><li>Added a FrameChangePercent field to the Bink structure, so you don't have to calculate it with the BinkGetRects
function.</li><li>Added some optimizations on Xbox 360, PS3 and Windows 64. Cartoon style videos are up to 15% faster.</li><li>Added support for background decompression on the Xbox 360.</li><li>Fixed the sound sync on PSP after resuming from a paused state.</li><li>In creating the SPU version, cut the library code/static data size by about 20K on all platforms.</li><li>Put more runtime temporary data on the stack - this saved about 26K of data previously allocated in BinkOpen.</li><li>No longer allocate the delta mask plane unless you call BinkGetRects or BinkCopyToBuffer - otherwise we save
another 8K or so.</li><li>Added the total video time in the file info window.</li><li>Show the video name in the Bink Player window.</li><li>Added support for Miles 7.1b.</li><li>Switched to the August Xbox 360 SDK.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.8w to 1.8x (08-11-2007)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.8w to 1.8x (08-11-2007)</b></a></div>

Fixed a problem in the Bink file header validation where partially compressed Bink files would be seen as corrupted.  This meant you couldn't
preview Bink files while they were still compressing in the front-end tool.</li><li>Added more bulletproofing to the audio frame reader to handle additional corrupted input Bink files.</li><li>Switched to the 1.90 PS3 SDK, and built with GCC 4.11.  The new GCC is terrific - it sped up decompression on the PS3 by 10%!</li><li>In the Bink compression tool, added an option to apply the alpha pre-multiplication before compressing.  Pre-multiplied alpha gives better quality, it filters better, 
and it's faster - everyone should use it.  Also, added an option to use pre-multiplied alpha during filtering (like resizing) and then convert back before compression.</li><li>Updated the examples on all of the platforms to allow you to specify whether you used pre-multiplied alpha.</li><li>Updated the PS3 GCM example to included a simple manager for mapped memory.</li><li>On Xbox 360 and PS3, rewrote the pixel shaders to be more efficient (although the GPUs are so fast on these platforms that it doesn't matter much).</li><li>On Windows, rewrote the 2.0 pixel shaders to be more efficient, and added an optional pixel shader 1.1 path to run on older DX8-class hardware.</li><li>On Wii, changed the example code to take into account as much information about the Wii texture iterators as is public to minimize resampling errors
when scaling a Bink video texture.  It's always best to try to play the movies at 1 to 1, though, since it seems impossible to remove all possible scaled sampling errors.</li><li>On Wii, fixed the pause feature so that it resumes the audio tracks immediately. Previously, it could take up to 700 ms for the audio to begin when you paused
and then resumed audio.</li><li>Fixed a problem in the front-end tools, where filenames in a list file had to be less than 128 characters long.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.8v to 1.8w (07-13-2007)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.8v to 1.8w (07-13-2007)</b></a></div>

kind support of this porting effort!</li><li>Added new DirectX 9 pixel shader example code for Win32 and Win64.  Pixel shaders are the 
fastest and highest quality method to display Bink videos.  If you are using Bink
in a 3D game on Windows, you should definitely update and use the new pixel shader example code.</li><li>Fixed some stuttering when closing and re-opening the cover of a Nintendo DS. You must call

All new infrastructure, all new assembly blitters.  This means almost 30% of Bink was replaced in this version.</li><li>All new x86 blitters for MMX and non-MMX: almost twice as fast, less buggy, no more corner cases, 
and saved almost 200K in the Bink DLL!</li><li>Added dithering to the 16-bit RGB color conversion blitters.  16-bit looks almost as good as 32-bit now.</li><li>Added a new 8-bit palettized output mode.  Also added a BinkGetPalette function to retrieve the global Bink palette.</li><li>Moved a few more source files and data tables into Bink sections, so you save another 64K or so, when you unload the Bink section on Xbox.</li><li>Changed a few of the examples to use BinkShouldSkip, so that they avoid locking a texture completely, if we are just
going to skip the frame anyway.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.8b to 1.8c (03-25-2005)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.8b to 1.8c (03-25-2005)</b></a></div>

way behind in playback and keep struggling to catch up.</li><li>Bumped to the March XDK for the Xbox 360.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Redmon next-gen console version where setting the volume could cause an assert in XAudio.</li><li>Updated to CodeWarrior 9.4 on MacOS.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.8a to 1.8b (03-02-2005)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.8a to 1.8b (03-02-2005)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added new Bink for Xbox support code that allows the use of hardware pixel shaders for the YcRcB color conversion.  This <b>doubles</b> the playback speed 
on an Xbox *and* uses 900 KB less memory *and* is much higher quality!  Using this feature, you can now play 1280x720 HDTV movies on the Xbox!!  This is such the `right thing to do` on an Xbox that
it is now the default playback method - if you have old Bink for Xbox code, you should definitely update it.</li><li>Added new Bink for Xbox examples for both normal video and alpha video pixel shader playback.</li><li>Added a few tweaks to the Xbox 360 support.</li><li>Fixed a silly typo that caused the pause key in the Bink player not to pause the movie.</li><li>Made a tweak to the QuickTime audio importer.  This should fix the -108 error when loading of QT audio tracks (which happens on a lot of camera movies).</li><li>Added a option on the Linux player to not play audio.  This avoids a crash in SDL on some Linux machines.</li><li>For sound input files with a .QT or .MOV file extension, we now always try QuickTime first.  This prevents broken
DirectShow filters (say for MPEG splitting) from preventing QT files from converting (when they really should 
be read with QT anyway).  We did this for video files previously, now we do it for sound too.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.7d to 1.8a (02-18-2005)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.7d to 1.8a (02-18-2005)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added support for this one unreleased next-gen console from a company over in Redmond (Xbox 360).</li><li>Added BinkGetFrameBuffersInfo and BinkRegisterFrameBuffers functions. These functions allow
you to allocate the Y, cR, and cB color buffers that Bink uses internally.  This allows you to do a lot of
cool things, like allocating the frame buffers as 8-bit luminance textures on Xbox, and then using 
a pixel shader to do the YcRcB to RGB conversion so that there is no blitting overhead at all (example of
this coming soon)!  This also allows you to share the same frame buffer memory for multiple Bink files
and save memory (as long as you don't play them all at once).</li><li>Added a BinkControlBackgroundIO function that allows you to suspend and resume the background
IO that Bink performs.  This makes it really easy to load other game data while 
a Bink is playing - you just suspend Bink when the Bink buffer is mostly full and resume it when it is mostly empty.
Great for playing a movie while your game loads level data.</li><li>Added a BinkShouldSkip function that allows you to query whether a frame or blit should be skipped.
This allows you to avoid calling BinkCopyToBuffer completely to check whether you are falling behind, so
you don't have to lock a texture or DDraw surface just to find out you should have skipped anyway. It's
also useful when using the BinkRegisterFrameBuffers function with textures, since you will never call BinkCopyToBuffer.</li><li>Made an adjustment to the audio encoder that makes deep bassy tones compress much better.</li><li>Fixed a goofy bug in the 32-bit still image importer that would cause the right-most pixels to display garbage.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the 16-bit YUV tables that caused unaligned 16-bit blits to be slightly dim.</li><li>For input files with a .QT or .MOV file extension, we now always try QuickTime first.  This prevents broken
DirectShow filters (say for MJPEG files) from preventing QT files from converting (when they really should 
be read with QT anyway).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.7c to 1.7d (01-08-2005)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.7c to 1.7d (01-08-2005)</b></a></div>

<b>Added a DirectShow video and audio importer</b> - this allows us to import a bunch of new file types! We can now import AVIs larger than 2GB, MPEG 1 videos (including the audio track), MPEG 2 videos (if you have a decoder installed), WMV videos (Windows Media), ASF files, MPEG-4 video files, DV video files, MJPEG videos, and tons of compressed audio formats (MP3 and WMA in particular).  Many file types that were previously decoded with QuickTime (which is really slow) are now handled by DirectShow.</li><li>Added support for LZW-compressed GIF and TIF files (patent expired).</li><li>Added AMD 64, AMD Opteron, SSE3, Hyperthreading, EM64T and Windows 2003 Server detection to the System Info button.</li><li>Switched to building radutil.dll with VS 2003 which has slightly faster code generation.</li><li>Fixed a bug when reading 48-bit TIFF files (which we only compress as 24-bit files).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the File Info button where the fractional part of the frame rate was reported incorrectly.</li><li>Bink now tries to refill the IO buffer when it falls under 75% of the highest one second's worth of data rate of the file. In previous versions, Bink tried to refill the IO buffer when it fell under 75% of the total IO buffer size.  This change allows you to now optionally use large IO buffers without having to worry causing occasional long delays to refill it.</li><li>You can now use the BINKNOFILLIOBUF flag in BinkCopyToBuffer to tell Bink not to refill the IO buffer when it falls under 75% of the data rate.  This is useful if you are holding a system lock and you always need BinkCopyToBuffer to complete as quickly as possible.</li><li>Bumped the Xbox stack size up to 32K.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.6f to 1.6g (11-03-2004)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.6f to 1.6g (11-03-2004)</b></a></div>

Fixed a bug where the Bink player for Mac couldn't highlight pre-compiled EXE video files.</li><li>Fixed a bug on the Mac in the BINKSURFACE32R and BINKSURFACE32RA YUV to RGB pixel converters
where a non-divisible by 4 right edge would draw with the wrong colors.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Mac Classic versions of the library and player where RemoveTimeTask couldn't
be found on pre-9.0 MacOS.</li><li>Added Mach-O format Carbon dynamic libraries for building Project Builder or CodeWarrior Mach-O applications without thunking.</li><li>Brought Bink Mac up to the latest PC source base (now uses Perforce and command line building
just like the PC, so it will always stay in sync).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5t to 1.5u (03-16-2003)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5t to 1.5u (03-16-2003)</b></a></div>

Bink playback is now much smoother on medium to low-end machines running Win 9x, due to working around
a multi-threaded bug in the system function, timeGetTime, that was eating up to 30% of the CPU!</li><li>Now properly handle the window being minimized when using DirectDraw primary surface blitting in the Bink player.</li><li>Fixed an edge bug when using BinkCopyToBufferRect with a non-divisible-by-4 width or height and a
non-zero left or top offset.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5s to 1.5t (02-06-2003)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5s to 1.5t (02-06-2003)</b></a></div>

Fixed the Smack and SmackMix tools when using old format Bink audio tracks.</li><li>We more support more dialects of TGA import files. This means we resort to QuickTime less 
often (which is good because QuickTime is slooow).</li><li>Fixed an debug assert in the Xbox SDK when setting very quiet (or silent) mix bin volume levels.</li><li>Fixed a crash when using waveOut audio output and the `play as fast as possible` frame rate option.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5r to 1.5s (01-14-2003)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5r to 1.5s (01-14-2003)</b></a></div>

Allowed the Smack and SmackMix tools to create old format Bink audio tracks.</li><li>Increased the Bink I/O block size from 8K to 16K (since Bink videos are slowly
using higher data rates).</li><li>Fixed a setting in the Bink SDK help where the navigation tab would disappear when
the focus was lost.  One stupid downside is that WinHelp remembers what the setting used to
be, so if you have no nagivation tab at all, then choose `Options... Show Tabs` on the menu bar.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5q to 1.5r (01-01-2003)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5q to 1.5r (01-01-2003)</b></a></div>

Fixed the accidental exclusion of the RADSetMemory function header file from the Bink SDKs.</li><li>Made the Bink Player only ask to check for updates if it is in the same directory as the RAD Video Tools.
This means that the free Bink Player can be distributed without popping up update requests.</li><li>We now poll the DirectSound buffer positions much less frequently to handle sound drivers that 
report these positions slowly.</li><li>We added a non-LTCG version of Bink for Xbox, so that `Edit and Continue` can be used again.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5p to 1.5q (11-18-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5p to 1.5q (11-18-2002)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Fixed a problem where our JPEG reader was detecting motion-JPEG QuickTime movies 
        as a single frame JPEG.  This had the effect of making motion-JPEG movies only 
	appear to be one frame, so only the first frame of the movie was ever converted.  
	We now force the use of QuickTime when the JPEG file is over 1.5 MB in size, or when the 
	extension is .QT or .MOV.</li><li>Fixed a bug when using the old Bink audio codec where stereo sound files would
        get converted to mono during compression. Note that there was no problem if you were using the 
	new Bink audio codec (which you should be anyway).</li><li>Fixed a bug when compiling a Smacker for DOS or Win16 video executable.</li><li>Did the big switch over to Perforce source code control.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5m to 1.5p (10-18-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5m to 1.5p (10-18-2002)</b></a></div>

Added MusyX audio output support for the GameCube SDK.  This caused a few API changes on the GameCube (even for non-MusyX games) because we no longer automatically assume you are using AX.  So, you must now call BinkSoundUseAX or BinkSoundUseMusyX before the first call to BinkOpen, or you won't get any sound. Also, RADSetAudioMemory has been removed (because only AX used it) - instead, you now pass in the ARAM callbacks to the BinkSoundUseAX function.</li><li>Updated all of the GameCude examples to let them be built AX or MusyX.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5L to 1.5m (10-04-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5L to 1.5m (10-04-2002)</b></a></div>

Added batch functionality to the RAD Video Tools! Now you can highlight a
group of input files and process them all one by one.</li><li>The RAD Video Tools now has built-in support for TGA and TIFF alpha
planes (previously QuickTime was used for alpha input). Our built-in support is almost
20 times faster than QuickTime, so compressing large numbers of still images
is now much, much faster!</li><li>Fixed a bug in the DirectSound support where changing the volume could be ignored.</li><li>Bumped up the default compression data rate to 400 kps.</li><li>Added a warning when you ask to compress an alpha plane and the 
input file has no alpha plane.</li><li>Switched to .NET for building the tools (a little faster
compiled code, but the debugger is frustrating).</li><li>Changed the sound support so that we only reset the sound system
every 2 minutes of video (less popping at loop points).  We also do the reset
on the first frame (previously we did it on the last frame which
occasionally popped).</li><li>Moved the end of file logic in the Xbox and GameCube example source
to fix a problem where playback could stop one frame early.</li><li>Show 2 decimal places when displaying frame rates in the RAD
Video Tools.</li><li>We now free the 2x height doubled YUV scanline buffers in BinkClose
(vs. shutdown in previous versions). This only saves about 1500 bytes, but 
it helps with fragmentation.</li><li>Changed the GameCube SDK to account for the slightly faster rate
that the NGC DSP <i>really</i> runs at.  Fixes sync problems with longer
movies on the GameCube.</li><li>Changed the Xbox and PC SDK to allocate the sound sample buffer on
the stack - saves 16K of global memory.</li><li>Now build the Xbox library using VC7's link time code generation. This
will generate both faster and smaller code. The file size of the library is 
large because the linker does the compilation - the link size in
bytes will be 10K to 50K smaller.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.5i to 1.5J (06-24-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.5i to 1.5J (06-24-2002)</b></a></div>

Added the BinkCopyToBufferRect function to the Bink SDK. This
function allows you to partially copy a Bink frame to another buffer.  You
can draw with tiled Direct3D textures much faster with this function.</li><li>Updated the DX8 and DX7 example programs to use the
BinkCopyToBufferRect function.</li><li>Changed the RAD 3D wrapper API slightly on PC to handle direct
locking of tiled textures.  You now need to call Lock_RAD_3D_image in a
loop to obtain each buffer pointer to copy into. See ExamAlph.c for the
updated example.</li><li>Released a new Carbon version of the Mac player (compatible with 
MacOS X and 9)!</li><li>Fixed a false positive condition when writing out an AVI that could cause the
'Windows has crashed' message to appear when everything was fine.</li><li>Updated the Mac version to the latest codebase.</li><li>Fixed an offset bug on the Mac in BinkBufferLock when running on certain
multi-monitor configurations.</li><li>Switched to an all new internal task sharing model on the Mac -
replaces all the cooperative thread stuff with timers and critical sections.
Much better IO and sound performance (fixes the MacOS X multi-CPU sound
skips).</li><li>On MacOS X, switched to using normal IO on a background thread instead of async IO.</li><li>Fixed a few bugs on the GameCube when playing videos with no sound.</li><li>Fixed the mixer to accept lossy levels greater than 100 (to specify the old Bink encoder
format).</li><li>Fixed the delay when using BinkGoto on a video without sound.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.2J to 1.5a (03-15-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.2J to 1.5a (03-15-2002)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added an all new Bink audio encoder!  Sounds much better and can
compress up to half the old data rate!</li><li>Added crash protection around all calls to Windows or QuickTime -
we should now withstand crashes in buggy 3rd party codecs.  The specific
frame that was being decompressed will be blank, but the rest of the movie
should survive.</li><li>Added several new Xbox SDK examples showing overlay and
back buffer support.  Overlays are really cool - they are definitely the
best way to play most videos on the Xbox.</li><li>Added YUY2 blitting support to the Xbox SDK - this allows the Xbox
hardware to do the YUV to RGB conversion (which is usually much faster).
Most of the examples now use YUY2 as the default texture format.</li><li>Added support for 3D Studio Max's RLA file format.  This format
supports RGB, alpha, Z-depth info, UV-coordinates, and normals - all per
pixel!  This lets you do some amazing post-process stuff with video that
you'd swear couldn't be pre-rendered.  We'll put up some demos of this soon!</li><li>Added lots of new configuration detection to the System Info button in
the RAD Video Tools (Duron, P4, Celeron, Itanium, Me, 2000, XP, video card,
audio card, memory, and disk space).</li><li>Detect larger than 2 GB AVI files and warn the user that they are
not supported by the Windows reader.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.2i to 1.2J (02-18-2002)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.2i to 1.2J (02-18-2002)</b></a></div>

upgrade.</li><li>Rewrote BinkGoto completely - you can now jump directly to a frame
and the sound will begin immediately (vs. the old 750 millisecond silence
delay).</li><li>Added new Direct3D 8 example texture support code.  Includes
support for dynamic and non-power of 2 textures (both of which can improve

NetMeeting was running.</li><li>Fixed a rare deadlock problem when a movie would loop (or when you called BinkSetSoundOnOff).</li><li>Fixed a data overrun that could cause pauses when playing a movie
that had no sound.</li><li>Made BinkGoto start the audio from the `gone-to` frame instead of
whatever filled up the sound buffer first.</li><li>Fixed BinkGoto to not unpause the movie if it was previously paused.</li><li>Removed Windows.h from the Bink header file (for faster compilation).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.2g to 1.2h (11-07-2001)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.2g to 1.2h (11-07-2001)</b></a></div>

Bink can now play multiple sound tracks at once.  This means that the BinkSetSoundTrack function now takes an array of track IDs to
play instead of a single value.  Also, the BINKNOSOUND constant has been removed - to play without any
sound, pass a zero for the track count in BinkSetSoundTrack.</li><li>Added example code in ExamXbox.cpp that shows how to play 5.1 audio on an Xbox.</li><li>Added the BinkSetMixBinVolumes function to adjust the mix bin
volumes individually on the Xbox.</li><li>BinkSetVolume, BinkSetPan, BinkSetMixBins functions all now take a
track ID to control which sound track is changed.</li><li>Worked around a DirectSound bug on the Xbox where the audio tracks
sometimes wouldn't start.  If we notice the sound positions aren't updating,
we restart the audio track.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.2c to 1.2d (10-02-2001)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.2c to 1.2d (10-02-2001)</b></a></div>

<b>Huge quality improvements</b> on videos with color gradiants, washes,

pipeline. In some cases, equivalent quality can be obtained at 1/4 the bandwidth!
If you need highest possible quality, <b>we recommend recompressing</b> all your
Bink videos.  The only downside is that video compression time is longer when
using super-high data rates (which you may not need any more).  These
improvements aren't hype - the quality difference is amazing in most cases!</li><li>Added a new denoising video filter (which is now rarely necessary 
with the new quality improvements).</li><li>Fixed a front-end problem in the video converter where half-toning 
was being applied if you selected `half-tone always` in the 256-color

Also worked around buggy SBLive drivers that would cause periodic
skipping under Windows 2000.</li><li>All new threading model - instead of one thread per open Bink, there
are simply two global threads for all open Bink files.  Also fixed a few very rare thread deadlocks on
multi-CPU machines (typically exhibited after more than 12 hours of looped playback).</li><li>Built with new beta versions of the Xbox system software - fixes
crash in BinkOpen on beta 1 and 2 Xbox hardware.</li><li>Fixed compression of unusual AVIs where the video stream format
doesn't match the file format (usually seen in Debabilizer AVI files).</li><li>Fixed a bug compressing unusual QuickTime movies where the audio
started at a non-zero offset.</li><li>Improved the Bink I/O system to give better playback when playing

Added three new display color depth options to the Bink player - `at
least high-color` (tries 16-bit, then 32-bit, and then 24-bit), `try
true-color` (tries 32-bit, then 24-bit, and then 16-bit), and `true-color
only` (tries 32-bit, and then tries 24-bit).</li><li>Checks the actual bit depth set after a call to
ChangeDisplaySettings to work around a bug in the NVidia drivers.</li><li>Bink player doesn't decompress sound that is going to be skipped
when playing in `as fast as possible` mode.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the 5551 merged alpha blitters.</li><li>Added two Bink alpha plane playback examples - DXALPHA.CPP for 
Direct3D and GLALPHA.C for OpenGL.</li><li>First version of Smacker 4.0 for the Mac!  PowerPC and 68K are both
supported (you should avoid using Bink audio in Smacker files that will be
played on 68K machines, though).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Smacker encoder where files compressed with Bink
audio tracks would be aligned incorrectly.  This led to too slow Smacker
files on the PC and unplayable files on the Mac.  You have to recompress the
Smacker file to fix the problem, though.</li><li>Renamed the SmackTimerRead function to RADTimerRead and switched to
using QueryPerformanceCounter (from timeGetTime) on Win32 - should make
movies play a little more smoothly on Windows NT and 2000.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the SmackGetRects function where an extra bogus
rectangle would be returned on a frame where a palette change occurred, but
no pixels changed.</li><li>In the Smacker player and SDK, broke out the time spent in the audio
and video decoders into separate values.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the Smacker player that cause an extra millisecond of
sleep for every frame.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the Bink encoder wouldn't read the alpha channel
out of an input Bink file.</li><li>Fixed a crash in the Mac SmackBuffer API when a NULL rectangle was
passing to SmackBufferBlit.</li><li>You can now override settings on the command line with a remove
switch.  For example, if you run `BinkPlay test /L`, you can tell Bink to
ignore the loop switch with `BinkPlay test /L /-L`.  The `slash-minus-L`
tells Bink to skip the earlier L switch.  This is mostly useful for
overriding the switches that are compiled into a self-playing Bink or
Smacker file.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.0g to 1.0h (03-14-2000)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.0g to 1.0h (03-14-2000)</b></a></div>

Added multi-CPU support to the Bink compressor!  Compression scales
        close to linearly with multiple CPUs - twice as fast for
        two CPUs, four times as fast for four CPUs, etc.</li><li>Added reversed order blitters (BINKSURFACE24R and
BINKSURFACE32R).  These are convenient under OpenGL where the reversed byte
path is more optimized.</li><li>Added merging alpha blitters (BINKSURFACE32A, BINKSURFACE32RA,
and BINKSURFACE4444).  These are used with Bink files that are compressed with
an alpha plane to get the merged formats commonly used by the 3D APIs.</li><li>Added the new online documentation system (with the system that
        Casey created for Granny).</li><li>Fixed a bug in the BinkBuffer API where the YUV formats were never
        tried if the DIBSection blitter failed.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 1.0e to 1.0f (02-08-2000)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 1.0e to 1.0f (02-08-2000)</b></a></div>

width and height.</li><li>Fixed the Bink colorspace conversion to match YUV hardware exactly
(Bink videos should look identical whether displayed with the hardware or

BinkBuffers to be used with full-screen DirectDraw applications.</li><li>Fixed an end-of-movie sound glitch when using DirectSound.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8h to 0.8i (05-12-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8h to 0.8i (05-12-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added the Bink converter which replaces the Graphics and Sound
Processor in Smacker.</li><li>The Bink converter can now convert video *and* audio at the same
time - allowing direct conversions from Bink or QuickTime into AVIs.</li><li>Fixed a threading crash if rapidly opening and closing Bink files.</li><li>Fixed the importing of 16-bit BMP files.</li><li>Added importing and exporting of PNG files.</li><li>Fixed monotonous multiple prompting for series of files when
creating a list when a run of files are selected.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8g to 0.8h (04-21-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8g to 0.8h (04-21-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added a frame rate adjustment feature.  Unlike the existing frame
rate changer, this feature will add or remove frames to maintain your
specified frame rate.  So, if you have a 15 fps animation and you adjust it
to 30 fps, then every frame will be copied twice.</li><li>Added decoding of Bink audio tracks to the utilities (you can now
Bink or Smack a Bink file).  This allows you to archive your videos in much,
much less space than uncompressed AVIs (just use a really high data rate for
archival purposes, say 2000000).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8f to 0.8g (04-16-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8f to 0.8g (04-16-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Fixed an overwrite bug when compressing small resolution videos.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8e to 0.8f (04-12-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8e to 0.8f (04-12-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added the Bink SDK manual and cleaned up a few problems in the SDK.</li><li>Fixed a bug when playing under NT close to the max data rate of the
device.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8d to 0.8e (04-02-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8d to 0.8e (04-02-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Fixed a nasty overflow in the data rate parameters which could cause
the data rate to grow linearly during a compression.  If the data rate of your movies seems too high, then you probably ran into this bug.</li><li>Smoothed playback somewhat for movies that are playing very close to
the maximum data rate of the playback device.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8c to 0.8d (03-31-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8c to 0.8d (03-31-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added much better background IO routines - can approach 100%
background IO even on Windows 95/98.</li><li>Made audio decompression much faster.</li><li>Added better frame skipping techniques.</li><li>Improved Bink compression speed somewhat.</li><li>Added a new redistributable Bink player (with no RAD credits) for
licensing.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8b to 0.8c (03-24-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8b to 0.8c (03-24-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Added a list file editor.</li><li>Fixed a bug when Binking a wave file.</li><li>Can detect pretty much any type of CPU now (used the Scitech code).</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.8a to 0.8b (03-23-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.8a to 0.8b (03-23-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
Rebuilt the Bink installation program to include the mixer.</li></ul><div class="discussion_heading"><a name='Changes from 0.0 to 0.8a (03-22-1999)' class='nohover'><b>Changes from 0.0 to 0.8a (03-22-1999)</b></a></div>
<ul><li><p>
The first version of Bink for general testing is released (Bink
Release Candidate 1)!</li><li>File format changed from earlier betas, this came with an almost 2x
quality improvement however - especially on low-bandwidth materials.</li><li>Codec technology is completely finished - tools still need minor
polishing, including the integration of Smacker.</li><li>This version of Bink requires DirectX to be installed.</li></ul><br>
